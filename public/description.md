Contains all static files like images, styles and javascript

This folder is for static files only. Usually, it has-sub folders like css, libs, and img for CSS styles, images and JavaScript libraries like jQuery. It’s a best practice this folder to be served not by your application but by an Nginx or Apache server as they are much better than Node in serving static files.
